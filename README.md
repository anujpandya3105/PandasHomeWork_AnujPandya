# Data Analysis for data set purchase_data.json. 

  One of the first observations that stands out is that   the bulk of the clientele is male , which is apparent from the 
the results from the "Gender Demographics". 81% of the purchasers are male and 17% female. Furthermore, the age group 
of the clientele ranges from 7 to 45. 
# As an analyst studying this data set , my focus would be on males under the age of 45.

  Upon further "drill-down" of the "Age Demographics", it becomes apparent that the bulk of the purchasers are in the 
20-24 years age group constituting 45% of the sales. Age groups 15-19 and 25-29 are next.
# As an analyst studying this data set , my focus would be on males under the age of between the ages of 15 and 29.

  Analyzing the most popular group, suggests that the price is not factor that drives popularity. Items are are less 
pricy are not necessarily the most popular. 
# As an analyst I would look into reason whey items like 	Betrayal, Whisper of Grieving Widows and Arcane Gem are
# more popular than the other despite being pricier.
